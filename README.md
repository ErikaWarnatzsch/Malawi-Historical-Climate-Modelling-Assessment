# Malawi-Historical-Climate-Modelling-Assessment
Python scripts to evaluate the ability of various RCM (CORDEX) and GCM models to hindcast climatic variables in Malawi. Specifically Temperature (mean, max and min) and Precipitation.

These scripts were created as part of a NERC funded PhD project. 

Erika Warnatzsch was funded by a NERC doctoral training partnership grant (NE/L002558/1).
